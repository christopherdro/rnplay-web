  <h2>What can I do with this site?</h2>
  <p>Build and test React Native applications with just a browser, and optionally an iOS device! <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">Learn more about React Native</a>.</p>

  <h2>How can I build an app and test it on the site?</h2>
  <p>Sign up and start playing right away with our in-browser editor and simulator. Once you're ready to test on a device, download the iOS app, then
    use the 'Run on Device' link and scan the QR code.</p>

  <h2>How do I 'exit' an app running inside the iOS app?</h2>
  <p>Long-press the screen with two fingers. After a few seconds, the base iOS app should appear.</p>

  <h2>How does this site work?</h2>
  <p>Apps are all hosted in their own git repositories on our servers. We run React Native packagers which serve transformed javascript to our custom iOS app, which is compiled with
    some <a href="https://github.com/rnplay/rnplay-ios/blob/master/package.json#L10-L25">community native modules</a>, available for use in your app.</p>

  <h2>How do I use git to push my app to the site?</h2>
  <p>First, install the command line client: <em>npm install -g rnplay-cli</em></p>
  <p>Sign up to the site, and <a href="https://rnplay.org/users/edit">grab your authentication token in your profile page</a>.</p>
  <p>Run <em>rnplay -a</em> and enter your email and token.</p>
  <p>From inside your React Native app directory, which should already have a git repository, run <em>rnplay -c</em>. Choose an application name:
    currently the name should match the registered module name in <em>index.ios.js</em>. This file must exist and be the app entry point.</p>
  <p>Now your app should be created on the site, with a new git remote added to your repo. <em>git push rnplay master</em> will push your master
     branch up. Now <em>rnplay -o</em> to open the browser to your app.</p>
  <h2>What limitations exist for testing apps here?</h2>
  <p>You may only use native modules from React Native itself, or those included with our iOS app.</p>
  <p>To prevent conflicts between react-native versions, git repos must not have git repositories as npm sources.</p>
  <p>Your app may not work if it uses features not available in our supported React Native versions. To run inside the iOS app, your
     app should work with the its React Native version: <strong>0.5.0</strong>.
  <p>Your app can't use images or other resources in the iOS app resource bundle, since we have no way to package those at runtime.
     Later, once React Native supports loading images from alternate bundles, we'll allow you to upload a resource bundle and download it from a URL into your app.</p>
